# Many-time-pad-attack
My own script to solve manually and interactively a many time pad attack. This project is still developing and in progress.

## Step 1:
Paste all the ciphers and the target cipher (if applicable) in the the "ciphers.txt".
- Every cipher starts with c[number] = 
- Every cipher is in hexadecimals

## Step 2:
Start the main.py

## Step 3:
Search for a first word in any of the ciphers.

## Step 4:
Once you have a starting point, it is a guessing game!
